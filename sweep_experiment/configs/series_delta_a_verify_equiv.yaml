# Series 25: Delta-A / Delta-B Equivalence Verification
#
# Delta-A and Delta-B (1 group, timestep target) are architecturally identical:
# both learn a single 512-dim additive vector to the timestep embedding.
# DB12 achieved 22.54 dB at LR=1e-2, 5 steps. If the methods are truly
# equivalent, Delta-A at the same hyperparameters should reproduce this result.
#
# We also test LR=1e-2 at 10 steps (to match DB13=22.53) and a range of
# lower LRs at 20 steps to find the optimal Delta-A operating point.
