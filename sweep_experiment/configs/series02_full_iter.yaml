# Series 2: Full-Model TTA -- Iteration Sweep
# Goal: Map loss curve over training steps at best LR from Series 1.
#        Determine overfitting onset and early stopping reliability.
# Fixed: learning_rate=BEST_FROM_S1
# Swept: num_steps, warmup_steps
# NOTE: Update learning_rate after Series 1 completes.
