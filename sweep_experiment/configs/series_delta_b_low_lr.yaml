# Series 24: Delta-B Low-LR Sweep (1 Group, 20 Steps)
#
# Motivation: Delta-B with 1 group achieves the best single-config PSNR
# (22.54 dB) at LR=1e-2 with only 5 steps. But at 20 steps with the
# same LR, it overfits to 21.21 dB. This sweep tests whether reducing
# the LR while keeping 20 steps can achieve similar peak performance
# with more stable optimization.
#
# The key insight: total gradient magnitude ~ LR * steps.
# LR=1e-2 * 5 steps ≈ LR=5e-3 * 10 steps ≈ LR=2.5e-3 * 20 steps.
#
# We also include LR=5e-4 (very conservative) to test whether the
# 1-group Delta-B can match Delta-A's robustness profile.
