# Delta-A Long Training Experiment
#
# Goal: Map the full anchor loss curve for Delta-A beyond 80 steps.
# We know Delta-A peaks at ~5 steps and degrades afterward.
# This run validates that the early stopping anchor loss correctly
# captures the degradation and identifies the optimal step.
#
# Also serves as a control: if ES (check_every=1, patience=10) correctly
# stops Delta-A around step 5-15, it confirms the ES mechanism works
# and the previous failure to trigger was purely due to check_every=5.
