# Series 11: Delta-C (Output Correction) -- LR Sweep
# Goal: Delta-C has only 16 trainable params (one per output channel).
#        Tests whether a simple per-channel bias correction on the velocity
#        prediction is useful. Needs high LRs due to tiny param count.
# Fixed: steps=20
# Swept: delta_lr
