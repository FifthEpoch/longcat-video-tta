# Re-run best methods with corrected early stopping
#
# Previous runs used es_check_every=5, es_patience=3 with 20 steps,
# making early stopping mathematically impossible to trigger.
# Here we re-run each method's best config with es_check_every=1
# and es_patience=5 at 40 steps to let ES find the true optimal step.
#
# This gives us:
#   - Proper early stopping behavior
#   - Best-step identification per method
#   - Anchor loss curves for analysis
